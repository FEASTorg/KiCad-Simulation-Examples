# Introduction

This collection of schematic circuits are used as examples by me when teaching my students. They are all ready for one click simulation, with all necessary SPICE-models included. There is a pdf-file for each of the schematic circuits, in case you only want the schematics. The schematics are made with [KiCad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiCad).
