# Introduction

This collection of schematic circuits are used as examples by me when teaching my students. They are all ready for easy simulation, with all necessary SPICE-models included. Some circuits are using built-in generic models. There is a PDF of the schematic for each of the circuits, in case you only want the schematic circuit.

## Simulation

To do a simulation, you access the "Simulate circuit in SPICE" button in the Schematic Editor. Then access "Run/Stop Simulation" button in the "Spice Simulator" window. To show the results of a simultaion, you must access the "Add Signals" or "Probe" button. Commands for the simulator is placed above the title field in the schematic.

## Engineering

The schematics are made with [KiCad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiCad).
